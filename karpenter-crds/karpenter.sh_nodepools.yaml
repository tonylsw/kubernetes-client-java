                NodePoolSpec is the top level nodepool specification. Nodepools
                launch nodes in response to pods that are unschedulable. A single nodepool
                is capable of managing a diverse set of nodes. Node properties are determined
                from a combination of nodepool and pod scheduling constraints.
